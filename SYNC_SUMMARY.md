# Synchronization Summary

## Date: 2025-10-29

## Changes Applied to Project

### 1. Corrected Notebook: `02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb`

#### Critical Fixes:
- **Example 3 (Engine Test)**: Fixed incorrect hypothesis direction
  - Changed from upper tail test to lower tail test
  - Corrected hypothesis: H₀: μ₁ - μ₂ ≥ -0.5, Hₐ: μ₁ - μ₂ < -0.5
  - Updated code: `tail = 'lower'` and `hypothesize_diff = -0.5`
  - Problem now correctly tests if new engine saves at least 0.5 gallons

#### Formula Table Fixes:
- Fixed column header: "Small Samples < 30" (was incorrectly "> 30")
- Corrected notation: $\bar{x}_2$ (was $\bar{\bar{x}_2}$)
- Corrected notation: $\mu_2$ (was $\mu_x$)

#### Example Enhancements:
- **Example 1**: Fixed typo "at 30 longer" → "at least 30 days longer"
- **Example 1**: Fixed table subscripts (n₂, x̄₂)
- **Example 2**: Added complete data table and hypothesis statements
- **Example 2**: Added note explaining two-tail vs upper-tail test choice
- **Example 3**: Added "#### Example" header
- **Example 3**: Fixed typo "tha" → "that"
- **Example 3**: Fixed table subscripts (n₂, x̄₂)
- **Example 3**: Added explanation for hypothesis direction

## Verification

### File Integrity Check:
```bash
# Both notebooks are identical
diff hypothesis-testing/02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb \
     portfolio/docs/notebooks/02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb
# Result: No differences (exit code 0)
```

### All Notebooks Present:
- hypothesis-testing project: 5 notebooks ✅
- portfolio project: 5 notebooks ✅

## Navigation Structure (Portfolio)

Portfolio MkDocs navigation correctly reflects all notebooks:

```yaml
- Hypothesis Testing:
  - Overview: hypothesis-testing.md
  - Introduction to P-Value: notebooks/01-intro-to-pvalue.ipynb
  - One-Tail and Two-Tail Tests (Means): notebooks/02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb
  - One-Tail and Two-Tail Tests (Proportions): notebooks/03_one_two_tail_test_diff_props.ipynb
  - Chi-Squared Test: notebooks/04-chi-squared.ipynb
  - Regression Hypothesis Testing: notebooks/05-regression-hypothesis.ipynb
```

## Documentation Status

### README Files:
- Both README.md files (hypothesis-testing and portfolio) are synchronized
- Both describe all 5 notebooks correctly
- Both include correct learning path
- No implementation-specific details that need updating

### hypothesis-testing.md (Portfolio):
- Already up-to-date with all notebook descriptions
- Includes correct test type table
- Practical applications section current
- No changes required
