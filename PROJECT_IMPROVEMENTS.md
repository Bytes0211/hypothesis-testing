- numpy>=1.24.0
- pandas>=2.0.0
- bokeh>=3.3.0
- scipy>=1.10.0
- matplotlib>=3.7.0
- seaborn>=0.12.0
- statsmodels>=0.14.0
- jupyter>=1.0.0
- ipython>=8.0.0

### .gitignore
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive Python patterns
- Added Jupyter notebook checkpoints patterns
- Added virtual environment variations
- Added utilities/ folder to ignore list
- Organized into logical sections with comments

### Makefile
**Changes:**
- Fixed clean target to include resources/__pycache__/

### Notebook Naming
**Changed:** `03_one_two_tail_test_diff_props.ipynb`  
**To:** `03-one-two-tail-test-diff-props.ipynb`  
**Reason:** Consistency with other notebook naming conventions

### Notebook 02 Content
Fixed grammar and factual errors in `02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb`:
- "and equal" → "an equal"
- "population" → "population means"
- "test" → "tests"
- "Its" → "It's"
- Improved sentence structure
- Added missing punctuation
- Fixed "Critical Value Value" → "Critical Value"

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dependency Management
- Complete list of required packages
- Version specifications to ensure compatibility
- Easy installation with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. Project Organization
- Separated unrelated utility files into utilities/ folder
- Consistent notebook naming convention
- Cleaner project structure

### 3. Documentation
- Added comprehensive contributing guidelines
- Added MIT License for clarity
- Created changelog for tracking versions
- Updated README with proper links

### 4. Development Workflow
- Improved .gitignore to prevent committing unnecessary files
- Enhanced Makefile for better cleanup

## Benefits

1. **Professional Structure** - Project now follows Python best practices
2. **Easy Onboarding** - Clear contributing guidelines and documentation
3. **Proper Dependencies** - All required packages explicitly listed
4. **Clean Repository** - Better .gitignore prevents clutter
5. **Installable Package** - Can be installed as a Python package
6. **Clear Licensing** - MIT License provides clear usage terms
7. **Version Tracking** - CHANGELOG helps track project evolution

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Consider adding unit tests for resources modules
- Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Create example notebooks with synthetic data
- Add type hints to Python modules
- Create API documentation with Sphinx
- Add badges to README (build status, coverage, etc.)
